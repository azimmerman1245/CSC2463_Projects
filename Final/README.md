## Final Project Documentation

The goal of this project was to build a functional keyboard using the p5 library of Java Script <br> <br>
	Core features include : <br>
		 - Tone.js synth whose attack is triggered upon press of specific keys on the keyboard <br>
     - Ability to change octaves through 'q' and 'z' keys <br>
       - With connected arduino and a formatted serial output, an attached button can also be used to change keys <br>
     - Animated keys that change color as you play them <br>

  Features whose implementation was attempted, but not completed : <br>
    - Record function <br>
    - Playback function <br>

  It is my hope that I can continue to work on this project and finish implementation of these features <br>
