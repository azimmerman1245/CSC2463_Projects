## Final Project Documentation

The goal of this project was to build a functional keyboard using the p5 library of Java Script
  Core features include : 
     - Tone.js synth whose attack is triggered upon press of specific keys on the keyboard
     - Ability to change octaves through 'q' and 'z' keys
       - With connected arduino and a formatted serial output, an attached button can also be used to change keys
     - Animated keys that change color as you play them

  Features whose implementation was attempted, but not completed :
    - Record function
    - Playback function

  It is my hope that I can continue to work on this project and finish implementation of these features
